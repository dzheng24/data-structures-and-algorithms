# Single Number
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

```
Example 1:

Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1


Example 2:

Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

- I used the objects/hashes approach for this problem. 
- Time complexity: O(n); it depends on n numbers of elements in the array. 
- Space complexity: O(n); the space required by the object depends on the n numbers of elements in the array.
