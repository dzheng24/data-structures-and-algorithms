# Breadth First Tree Traversal
- Code Challenge 17

## Challenge 
- Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited nodeâ€™s value.

## Approach & Efficiency
I haven't come up with a solution to solve this problem yet. With the implementation of a Queue class, I'm close to the solution. I will continue to work on this one.
