# Happy Number 

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.


Example:

Input: 19

Output: true

Explanation: 
- 1<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> = 82
- 8<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 68
- 6<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> = 100
- 1<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> = 1

Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)
